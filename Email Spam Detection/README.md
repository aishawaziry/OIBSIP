# Email Spam Detection
## Most of us have received spam emails at some point in our lives. Spam mail, also known as junk mail, refers to emails that are sent to a large number of users simultaneously. These emails often contain cryptic messages, scams, or even phishing content, which can be highly dangerous. In this project, we will use Python to develop a spam email detector. We will then use machine learning techniques to train the spam detector to accurately classify emails as either spam or non-spam.
