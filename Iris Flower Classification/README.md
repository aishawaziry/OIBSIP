#  Iris Flower Classification
## The Iris Dataset is a popular dataset in machine learning, consisting of information about various flower species. The dataset includes four independent features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width, with measurements given in centimeters. The dependent feature, which will serve as the output for any models trained on this dataset, is the Species of the flower. This feature contains the name of the specific flower species to which each observation belongs, based on its measurements.
## The classification models used are logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and support vector machines (SVM).
